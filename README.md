Using Jason Web Tokens for authentication example project 1
This is a working WebApi (Controller) example of using Jason Web Tokens to authorize a user. You can use this to register a user , login , cretae a JWT security token to authorize
a user to have access to only methods you authorize them for (decorate these methods with the Authorize attrbute in a production version). 
Of course this is only a working example and most of the "secutity work" would be done using a repsository model and not as a fat controller.
You can test this example using Swagger or Postman if you wish.
I also plan on doing a role based authorization example next.
